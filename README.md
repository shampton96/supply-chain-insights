## 🧠 About Me

Hi, I'm **Stephanie Hampton**, a senior data analyst who thrives on solving puzzles and transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights for users at every level.

I’ve always been drawn to brain teasers—jigsaw puzzles, escape rooms, daily crosswords—but my passion for data truly took off in 2017. Fresh out of college and struggling in a sales role, I found myself far more interested in analyzing my team’s stats in Excel than making cold calls. That curiosity followed me through my next few jobs, where I constantly searched for ways to uncover inefficiencies and recommend improvements—even when a spreadsheet was my only tool.

In 2022, I landed a role that changed everything: a company willing to take a chance on me and let me work exclusively in **SQL** and **Power BI**, despite my limited formal experience. Within six months, I had become the team’s SQL subject matter expert and the go-to designer for dashboards, supporting over 400 end users—including senior directors and VPs.

Since then, I’ve expanded my toolset to include:

- **SQL, Power BI**
- **Azure Data Factory, Azure DevOps, Storage Explorer**
- **SAP ECC, SAP HANA**
- **Logic Apps, Power Automate, Tableau**
- Currently learning: **Python, Databricks**

What sets me apart is the combination of technical depth and communication skills. I don’t just write queries—I ask the right questions, uncover root causes, and translate insights into clear, actionable narratives. I thrive in cross-functional teams and believe that the ability to explain data to non-technical audiences is just as important as the analysis itself.

🎮 As a long-time fan of *Fallout* and the immersive, choice-driven worlds Bethesda creates, I’d be thrilled to contribute to a studio that values curiosity, creativity, and collaboration.  
📊 Analyzing what makes a game fun, balanced, and unforgettable? That sounds like the ultimate quest.
