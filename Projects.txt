# Supply Chain Analytics and Insights Dashboard

**Overview**
Welcome to my Supply Chain Analytics and Insights Power BI project. This suite of dashboards was designed to empower supply chain stakeholders, including planners, buyers, and leadership, with critical, real-time insights to improve planning, execution, and decision-making across the value chain.

Each report is purpose-built to address a specific need, from material planning and exception handling to performance monitoring and self-service analytics.
